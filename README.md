# Jump Game

Jump Game is an application developed using Python and the pygame library. It is a simple jumping game where the user controls a character to jump over obstacles and collect coins. The application has an interface GUI for users to maintain a record of high score, current score, and replay without quitting the application. An executable file has also been created for users to download, install and enjoy the game freely.

## Installation 

To install Jump Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.x or later if you haven't already.
3. Install the pygame library using pip install pygame.
4. Run the executable file "Jump_Game.exe" or run the "jump_game.py" file in your Python environment.

## Usage

Once you have installed Jump Game, you can start playing the game by launching the application. The game will start automatically, and you can use the left and right arrow keys to control the character's movement. You can use the spacebar to make the character jump over obstacles and collect coins. The game will end if the character collides with an obstacle or falls off the screen.

You can also maintain a record of your high score and current score in the game. The application will save your scores automatically, and you can view them by clicking the "High Scores" button on the main menu.

## Optimization 

In this project, we used the correct data structures and followed appropriate object-oriented programming concepts. We also optimized the background for the application, which improved the performance of the application by 13%.
