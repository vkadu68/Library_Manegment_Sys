# City Library Management System

This is a full-stack web application for managing a city library's collection of books and patrons. With this system, librarians can perform functions such as searching for books, reserving books for patrons, checking out books, and calculating fines for late returns. The application was developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, PHP, and PHP MyAdmin as the database server.

## Features
Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
Reserve books for patrons
Check out books to patrons
Calculate fines for late returns
Display the library's collection and patrons' records
Entity Relationship Diagram
To effectively manage the library's collection and patrons, we designed an entity relationship diagram that defines the relationships between 8 tables. The diagram ensures the integrity and consistency of data, and allows for efficient querying of data. We also used indexing to reduce the table size by 25%, which improved the performance of the system.


## Installation and Usage
To use the City Library Management System, you need to have a web server with PHP and PHP MyAdmin installed. Here are the steps to install the system:

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/vkadu68/city-library.git
Import the database schema and sample data to your PHP MyAdmin server.

Configure the db.php file with your database connection details.

Start your web server and navigate to index.php to use the system.
